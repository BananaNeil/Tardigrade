# Cawdrivium
Prototype Caw implementation for the seven classically liberal arts

## Caw/schism/
The open and anonymous nature of CAW has made it difficult to discern the true intent of the creators. Some think it is a payment network stablecoin (yawn) while others think it is an open call for social networks (why I'm here).  From the perspective of an implementer, one always asks first, is token needed? Such a social network can sig send eth and mint its own usernames no problem, its just without a community and a means of traversing different social networks, depriving of the grid mesh.  I hope to the day the light of the truth shines upon this coin, and finds it to be true to the story of some dude putting his own liquidity down, pasting the manifesto online, and driving some community botnets to impress the GPT-market machine to try to get a non-corporate metaverse.  Till then, I build with an Cawdrivium escape hatch.

## About

[CommunityCaw](https://twitter.com/CommunityCaw) drafted a [specification](https://www.reddit.com/r/SatoshiStreetBets/duplicates/up121h/caw_white_paper_decentralized_social_network/) for a decentralized social network that contains an open call for implementors.  Cawdrivium attempts to implement and explore the specification around a conservative starting point for a social media that cryptographically denies the right to be forgotten, the seven classical liberal arts; Grammar, Logic, Rhetoric through Geometry, Mathematics, Astronomy and Music.  It was after the bubonic plague that the Renaissance emerged, and now we have all seen the outcome of a world where knowledge and wisdom is monopolized over the ignorant for profit and prestige.  Cawdrivium hopes to offer a place where we can collectivly offer the opportunity of acheiving liberalis, the quality of being a free man, to each other.

## Goals
There is many ways to skin this specification so to speak.  The current goal of Cawdrivium is to simply start testing out some opinions, and hopefully solicit some feed back as different options on the tech stack are tried out. All Code and feedback is welcome, consider this a research project for now, (in fact the Caw creator seems apprehensive of accepting solo projects :))

## Technology Notes

[EIP-2535](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535) While the specification calls for no proxy contracts.  The developer may have been unfamiliar with a new emerging standard the Diamand multi-facet proxy.  It is possible in this standard to make the proxy immutable by removing the editing function, so one can acheive immutability while utilizing its other benefits like unlimited contract size, avoiding passing large structs between contracts, and terseness, not having to import endless interfaces.  

It is the proposal of this developer that this set of contracts is too complex to yolo a one and done contract.  And that instead a *nightly* version of the protocol is build mutably on the diamond, battle tested by the community, than frozen as the current version.  Updates can be started in a new nightly diamond.

[StandardERC20](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf3b9569F82B18aEf890De263B84189bd33EBe452#code) is an autogenerated contract by a tool perhaps similar to [erc20-create](https://vittominacori.github.io/erc20-generator/) all well and fine, but this does block the 0x000 burn address.  As such Caw burns are directed to the [0x0...0dead](https://etherscan.io/address/0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead)  

The Crux on the smart contract side seems to be faciliting the [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) v4 signatures that stand in as a sort of micropayment channel for incentives for the liking, creating and following of Caws.  I'd like to exploring perhaps even doing an internal merkle tree structure, and to see if many users can chain permits to the same message.

[web3-react](https://github.com/NoahZinsmeister/web3-react) react typescript seems to be the bread and butter of front end web3 at the moment

Still exploring persistent storage and message ques.  Would love to hear debates between the different storage medium.  I am thinking initially I'll explore Arweave or filecoin, and than orbit-db or the like for the passing of materials.
