If a connection to a better price is found, but unable to be potentiated due to insufficient transmission media than it obviates the nessesity to assess the infrastructure.  A recurring pattern is what I\'m come to define as baggage of a medium.   To issue a statement from a tweet is to first and for most say \'twitter\' itself.  Following the example, if there was high value add information being computationally and algorithmically censored, and one were to diagose the cause for censorship to be \'cant risk brand image on (insert array of wrongthink)\' than naturally entreprenurs would attempt to ship around it. \\n\\nContext is often key, and is found elucidated in an ideas tradition, a tradition composed by the potentiations of that idea.
