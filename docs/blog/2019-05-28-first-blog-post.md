As the saying goes, secrets form the fountain of profit, and [The Intrinsic Value Thesis for Digital Media](https://intrinsicresearch.substack.com/p/intrinsic-value-model-for-digital?s=r),

Tardigrade, than, envisions a toolset to become collectively creative in manifesting entrepenurial knowledge networks.
